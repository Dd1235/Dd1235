Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a first-year Computer Science student at [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), deeply passionate about the magic of backend technologies and the endless possibilities of Arduino projects. 🚀

- 🔭 Currently, I'm honing my skills in **Backend Development**, focusing on **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **GraphQL**. I love how these technologies empower me to build robust and scalable server-side applications.
- 🌱 On a nostalgic note, I’m also revisiting my roots in **Arduino projects**. There's something incredibly satisfying about bringing hardware to life with code, and I’m excited to blend this with my backend knowledge for some innovative creations.
- 👯 I’m on the lookout to collaborate on projects that leverage my backend expertise or Arduino enthusiasm. Whether it's creating IoT solutions or crafting powerful APIs, I'm all in.
- 🤔 Seeking guidance on advanced **Node.js** patterns and best practices in managing **MongoDB** databases efficiently.
- 💬 Happy to chat about anything related to **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, **GraphQL**, or **Arduino**. If you're interested in these areas or have insights to share, let's connect!
- 📫 Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dedeepya-avancha-507363217/)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Beyond the world of code, I love exploring the mysteries of the cosmos and the stories of ancient civilizations. 🌌🏺

Excited to explore the intersection of software and hardware, and to make meaningful contributions to the open-source community! Let's make something awesome together. ✨
